	<p style="font-size:42px">My first experience of the UAE National Day was awesome. The festivities at school was wonderful, the school was decorated with UAE colors and we wore traditional clothes from UAE and all the students brought UAE traditional food.</p>
	<br><br>
	
	
	<p style="font-size:42px">During the assembly time, we gathered near building two and we waited until the Islamic prayer was finished. After that, the UAE national anthem was played and all the students sang it. We also wore the Kandura and some also wore the scarfs with UAE National Day print.</p>
	<br><br>
	
	<p style="font-size:42px">After the national anthem, a teacher gave a speech about the national day and then the TPGS hymn was played. We then proceed to decorate the bulleting board, me and my classmates helped each other doing so. Our class adviser also asked us to draw famous UAE tourist spots that we will put in the bulletin board.</p>
	<br><br>

	<p style="font-size:42px">The highlight of the celebration was the food competition, all students brought different kind of UAE traditional food. We organized all the food on the table and we lined up near the table to take a picture of. Then the judges came to check the foods we prepared, they also tried the foods together with teachers from other classes.</p>
	<br><br>

	<p style="font-size:42px">It was really a day to remember, I am very happy with the experience especially trying the tradional foods together with my classmates. Thank you for reading my story..</p>
